name: Synthetic brain MR spectroscopy data - sLASER - TE: 35ms - 3T
abstract: "Synthetic MR spectroscopy data for quantification purposes (included ground-truth concnetration levels) of use for benchmarking (model fitting, machine learning or neural networks algorithms) or of use in deep learning contexts for pre-training, fine-tuning or ablation study.

Various dataset size and distribution of concentrations for *brain* spectra are included (for full description, see README.md file available at the URL reported below or at https://github.com/bellarude/MRS_detasets).
Variation of shim quality, SNR levels and MMBG contribution are included.
Spectra are free of 0th- and 1st-order phase offset as well as freqeuncy drifts.
(optional) Additional downscaled water signal is added (for some datasets) for quantification referencing.
(otpional) Spectral preprocessing to spectrogram is included.
