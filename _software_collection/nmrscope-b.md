excerpt: "NMRScopeB"


name: NMRScopeB (part of jMRUI)
image: /assets/images/software/jmrui_thumb.jpg
developer: Zenon Starcuk, Jana Starcukova
type: simulation
abstract: "As a plugin to jMRUI, NMRScopeB provides the functionality useful for assembling metabolite basis set for metabolite concentration estimation in jMRUI or other software packages. In the simulation, properties such as chemical shifts, spin-spin coupling, relaxation, spatial and/or spectral excitation selectivity, and customized pulse sequences are accounted for. The simulator can be also used for MR study and method development."
language: Python, C++, Java
