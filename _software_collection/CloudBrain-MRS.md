abstract: "CloudBrain-MRS is a cloud-based computational platform for MRS data. The platform deploys the mainstream quantification tool LCModel and advanced deep learning denoising and quantification algorithms. The platform has been developed with a module for the statistical analysis of biomarkers. Users can batch preprocess and quantitative analysis MRS data with only one browser. The platform has been developed with a range of visualization techniques to provide a user-friendly interface."  
language: Python, JavaScript
