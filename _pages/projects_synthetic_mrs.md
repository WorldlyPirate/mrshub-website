## Synthetic MRS

  ![Overview of Objectives and Goals](/assets/images/synthetic_mrs/syntheticdata.png)


#### Objectives and End goals:
1. Produce comprehensive and universal summary/recommendations for simulating synthetic spectra with use case-specific recommendations when necessary
2. Create a community-based synthetic data generator tool (based on the information we gather in step 1)

#### Use Case Categories

Define general and case-specific recommendations:
1. Hardware optimization
2. Acquisition/sequence optimization
3. Validation of processing/analysis tools
4. Machine learning applications
